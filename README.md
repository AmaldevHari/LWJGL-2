# LWJGL(OpenGL)
 
Games made using LWJGL which is an OpenGL frameword for java.
Games inside: Pong
                            
Instructions to run Pong after cloning to a different device:
The jar files which are required for this game that are included in this repo: they are lwjgl.jar, lwjgl_util.jar and slick.jar
Add these as external jars and remove the path I have already built for these files.

Then you will need to download LWJGL natives(for your OS)  from this website:https://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.9.3/

after extracting the natives folder:
From eclipse, go to configure build path -> libraries -> JRE System Library -> click on Native library location -> locate to the extracted natives folder

Compile and run :)
